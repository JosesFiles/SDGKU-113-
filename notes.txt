New Django Project:

    First Create Project folder:
        mkdir *name of project*
    
        go into directory:
            cd "name of project*

    Create and activate new Virtual Environment:
        python3 -m venv venv && source/bin/activate  #(Installs and activates venv in one line)

    Install Django within the Virtual Environment:
        pop3 install django

    Start new Django project:
        django-admin startproject config .

    Immidiately migrage project files:
        python3 manage.py migrate

    test django install:
        python3 manage.py runserver.
            ctrl+click to test install, you should see the rocket launching:
        
    Close server    
        ctrl+C

    Create all apps you think you'll need:
        python3 manage.py startapp pages....or posts....or accounts etc.

    install apps ready to be installed.
        open VSC using:
            code .
                open config.settings.py:
                    go to INSTALLED_APPS:
                        add apps you just created at bottom after all exiting apps..  (add full name when possible)
                            example: 
                                instead of just adding:
                                    'pages'
                                    try adding:
                                        'pages.apps.blog' in order to not miss any features.

    update any models inside any apps you've created:

        python manage.py makemigrations cities
        python manage.py migrate

Once models and migrations are complete you can add Superuser :
    
        python3 manage.py createsuperuser
            -follow prompts  

            

    go to folder for one of your appas and edit views.py:
        replace code with :
            from django.views.generic import TemplateView

            class HomePageView(TemplateView):
                template_name = "path/home.html"
            
            class AboutPageView(TemplateView):
                template_name = "path/about.html"

    To create those pages:
        open config.settings.py 
            look for TEMPLATES = [
                inside the "DIRS" [], 
                    insert the following:
                        [str(BASE_DIR.joinpath('templates"))
It is quicker to create these files in terminal:
            mkdir -p templates/pages            #created templates and posts directories
            touch templates/base.html           #created base.html at the root of templates

            back in VSC 
                new files:
                    home.html
                    about.html

    Open templates.pages.html:
        extend base.html    
            {% extends 'base.html %}        

        add blocks (title/content)
            {% block title %}TITLE{% endblock title %}
            {% block content %}
                <h1>Home</h1>
                    etc...html stuff
            {% endblock content %}


    Open base.html
        use emmet !
        add block title like above
        add block content inside divs.
        add navbar using cdn and script code
        connect links to templates

    go to config.urls.py
        instructions are above
            add include on django.urls import

        urlpatterns = [
            add
                path("", include(pages.urls)),


go to pages directory and create:
    urls.py file:
        from django.urls import path
    from .views import HomePageView, AboutPageView

    urlpatterns = [
        path("", HomePageView.as_view(), name="home"),
        path("about/", HomePageView.as_view(), name="about"),
    ]

    From TERMINAL:
     
        python3 manage.py migrate

    Launch server to test:
        python3 manage.py runserver 

     open posts   
        from django.db import models
from django.urls import reverse
class Post(models.Model):
    add:
            title = models.CharField(max_length=128)
            subtitle = models.CharField(max_length=128)
            author = models.ForeignKey(
                'auth.User',
                    #model responsible for handling underlying user table.
                on_delete=models.CASCADE
                    #if users are deleted so will all their posts.
            )
            body = models.TextField()
            created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
            active = models.BooleanField(default=True)

            def __str__(self):     # The STRdunder method takes the memory object and returns a print statement.
                return self.title

            def get_absolute_url(self):
                return reverse("detail", args=[self.id])
Create Views for POST:
        open posts.views.py
            add:
                    from django.views.generic import (
                    DetailView,
                    ListView,
                     )
                    from django.views.generic.edit import(
                        CreateView,
                        DeleteView,
                        UpdateView,
                    )


                    from .models import Post
                    from django.urls import reverse_lazy


                    class PostListView(ListView):
                        template_name = "posts/list.html"
                        model = Post


                    class PostDetailView(DetailView):
                        template_name = "posts/detail.html"
                        model = Post


                    class PostCreateView(CreateView):
                        template_name = "posts/new.html"
                        model = Post
                        fields = ["title", "subtitle", "author", "body", "active"]


                    class PostUpdateView(UpdateView):
                        model = Post
                        template_name = "posts/edit.html"
                        fields = ["title", "subtitle", "body", "active"]


                        def form_valid(self, form):
                            response = super().form_valid(form)
                            # Perform additional actions here
                            return response

                    class PostDeleteView(DeleteView):
                        template_name = "posts/delete.html"
                        model = Post
                        success_url = reverse_lazy("list")
The migrate and superuser parts are in first part of that post I think.
